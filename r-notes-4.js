// Firebase: great PAAS to use for many different mobile and web apps, great free tier, we get databases, authentication, file storage, hosting, etc
// followed gist to set up project and firebase at https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/caab8ebd8ff4b6e947632887e0183761

// made dummy document entry in collection to work with, got free stock photos from unsplash
//documentation is pretty good

//firebase v.6 implements getAuth() by storing document in IndexedDB.  V.5 used to store inside local Storage
